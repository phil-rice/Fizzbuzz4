# Goals
* Use tests
* Use type classes: ints, strings, money, bigdecimals… all can be fizzbuzzed…
    * Think about being lazy: How to do this with the minimum work?
* Add .fizzbuzz to all things that have the type class
    * This returns the result defined below


# Definition of problem(the string returned by .fizzbuzz)
* Return “fizz”, “buzz” or “fizzbuzz”.
* For a given number return:
    * “fizz” if the number is dividable by 3
    * “buzz” if the number is dividable by 5
    * “fizzbuzz” if the number is dividable by 15
    * A string representing the number if none of the above apply
